It features bright, primary colors on a white background. It is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light UI scheme, and Dark UI scheme).\n\n### Installation\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```sh\napm install fizzy-dark\n```\n\nThen go to `Atom > Preferences > Themes` and in the `Syntax Themes` dropdown, select `Fizzy Dark` from the list.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dualmoon/fizzy-dark/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dualmoon/fizzy-dark","_id":"fizzy-dark@0.18.2","_shasum":"69b3c4bf5ab6b72446c4c3d6e979a728f7103ed3","_resolved":"file:../d-115428-42415-9gxr9v/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115428-42415-9gxr9v/package.tgz"}
